# Introduction

## Task Definition

At the end of the year, each apprentice who worked in the ZLI is required to do a project of their own choosing. They have to plan, execute and document an appropriate project over the span of 4 weeks, while working Monday - Wednesday (or Wednesday - Friday, depending on their school days). With this project, the apprentices can demonstrate what they have learned from the coaches during the last year, as all competences required to fulfill the project have been topics during this past year, some have been used very frequently, while others have only been discussed during 1 week.

## Project Description

I chose to create a Notes App using Rust. I initially wanted to make a To-Do App, but as I have already done a To-Do App using Dart & Flutter as my Sportferienprojekt, I chose to go with something different. I want to try to write this project purely in Rust, to see how much of the language I have learned during the last year, and I can definitely learn new things from this project too. Because Rust is quite famous for being a really safe programming language, I want to try and implement one or two ways to encrypt and store the data safely.

## Known Risks

I know that creating an application purely in Rust might be difficult, especially because Rust isn't really made to design, but to work. To implement a GUI, you have to use crates, which are known to sometimes be even more difficult than the standard Rust syntax itself. And Rust itself has a pretty steep learning curve too. Managing lifetimes, references, and borrowing can be complex, especially with dynamically changing data like note content. On top of that, Rust's error system (e.g., `Result` and `Option`) is safe but verbose, requiring you to explicitly handle many cases.
