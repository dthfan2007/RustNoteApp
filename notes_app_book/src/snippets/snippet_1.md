# Snippet 1: Initiating `eframe`

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), eframe::Error> {
    let options = eframe::NativeOptions {
        viewport: egui::ViewportBuilder::default()
            .with_min_inner_size([650.0, 465.0]) // Set minimum window size
            .with_title("Secure Notes") // Set app bar title
            .with_maximized(true) // Start in fullscreen
            .with_decorations(true), // Show the decorations (Minimize, Close, App Title)
        ..Default::default()
    };

    eframe::run_native(
        "Secure Notes",
        options,
        Box::new(|_cc| Ok(Box::new(NotesApp::new()))),
    )
}
```

This snippet contains the main entry point for the Secure Notes application. The `main()` function:

## Application Entry Point and Window Configuration

This snippet represents the foundational entry point of the Secure Notes application, built using the eframe framework which provides cross-platform native GUI capabilities for Rust applications. The main function serves as the critical initialization point where the entire application lifecycle begins.

### Detailed Function Analysis

**`main() -> Result<(), eframe::Error>`**

This is the primary entry function that orchestrates the complete application startup sequence. It performs several crucial initialization tasks:

**Window Configuration Setup:**

- **Viewport Builder Configuration**: The function creates a comprehensive window configuration using `egui::ViewportBuilder`, which is eframe's way of defining how the application window should appear and behave on the user's desktop
- **Minimum Size Constraints**: Sets a minimum inner window size of 650x465 pixels, ensuring the application maintains usability even when resized to smaller dimensions. This prevents UI elements from becoming cramped or unusable
- **Window Title Definition**: Establishes "Secure Notes" as both the internal application name and the visible title that appears in the operating system's window title bar and taskbar
- **Maximized Launch State**: Configures the application to start in a maximized state, providing users with the full screen real estate immediately upon launch, which is particularly beneficial for a note-taking application where screen space is valuable
- **Window Decorations**: Enables standard window decorations including the minimize button, maximize/restore button, close button, and the title bar itself, ensuring the application follows standard desktop application conventions

**Application Instantiation and Launch:**

- **Native Application Runner**: Uses `eframe::run_native()` to create and launch the native application window with all the specified configurations
- **Application Factory**: Provides a closure that creates a new instance of `NotesApp::new()`, which is the main application struct that contains all the application state and logic
- **Error Handling**: Returns a `Result` type that can propagate any initialization errors that might occur during the application startup process

**Cross-Platform Considerations:**
This initialization code is designed to work seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) thanks to eframe's cross-platform abstraction layer. The window management, decorations, and sizing behavior will automatically adapt to each platform's native conventions while maintaining consistent functionality.

**Performance and Resource Management:**
The initialization is designed to be lightweight and fast, ensuring quick application startup times. The configuration options chosen here balance functionality with performance, providing a responsive user experience from the moment the application launches.

- **Configures the application window**: Sets minimum size (650x465), title, and starts maximized
- **Initializes the eframe GUI framework**: Creates the native window with specified options
- **Launches the NotesApp**: Starts the main application loop with the NotesApp struct

This is the foundation that creates and displays the GUI window for the entire application.
