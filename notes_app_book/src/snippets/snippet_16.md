    .or_else(|_| env::var("USERNAME"))
    .unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_user".to_string());
components.push(format!("user:{}", username));
```

The user identity component provides several security benefits:

**Cross-Platform Username Detection:**

- **Audit Trail**: Provides user context for security auditing

**Home Directory Fingerprinting:**

```rust
if let Ok(home) = env::var("HOME").or_else(|_| env::var("USERPROFILE")) {
    components.push(format!("home:{}", home));
} else {
    components.push("home:unknown".to_string());
}
```

The home directory component adds another layer of security binding:

**Path-Based Security:**

- **Directory Binding**: Binds encryption to specific directory structures
- **User Space Integration**: Integrates with user-specific file system areas

**Operating System and Architecture Fingerprinting:**

```rust
components.push(format!("os:{}", env::consts::OS));
components.push(format!("arch:{}", env::consts::ARCH));
```

The system-level fingerprinting provides fundamental device characteristics:

**Operating System Identification:**

- **Platform Binding**: Binds encryption to specific operating system platforms
- **Version Independence**: Uses OS family rather than specific versions for stability
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works across Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms
- **Stability**: OS family rarely changes, providing stable fingerprinting
- **Security Context**: Provides security context about the operating environment

**Architecture Detection:**

- **Hardware Architecture**: Identifies CPU architecture (x86, x64, ARM, etc.)
- **Instruction Set Binding**: Binds to specific instruction set architectures
- **Performance Characteristics**: Different architectures have different performance profiles
- **Security Features**: Different architectures have different security capabilities
- **Compatibility Assurance**: Ensures compatibility with architecture-specific features

**Computer Name Integration:**

```rust
let computer_name = env::var("COMPUTERNAME")
    .or_else(|_| env::var("HOSTNAME"))
    .or_else(|_| env::var("NAME"))
    .unwrap_or_else(|_| "unknown_computer".to_string());
components.push(format!("computer:{}", computer_name));
```

The computer name component provides device-specific identification:

**Multi-Platform Name Detection:**

- **Windows Support**: Uses `COMPUTERNAME` for Windows systems
- **Unix Support**: Falls back to `HOSTNAME` for Unix-like systems
- **Alternative Detection**: Tries `NAME` as additional fallback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provides default when computer name is unavailable
- **Network Integration**: Computer names often integrate with network identity

**Device Identity Binding:**

- **Unique Device Identification**: Provides unique identification for individual devices
- **Network Context**: Computer names often reflect network configuration
- **Administrative Control**: Computer names are typically set by system administrators
- **Change Detection**: Can detect when computer names are changed
- **Enterprise Integration**: Integrates with enterprise naming conventions

**Component Consistency and Ordering:**

```rust
components.sort();
```

The sorting system ensures consistent fingerprinting across sessions:

- **Deterministic Ordering**: Ensures components are always in the same order
- **Hash Consistency**: Consistent ordering produces consistent hash values
- **Cross-Session Stability**: Same components produce same fingerprint across sessions
- **Debugging Reliability**: Consistent ordering aids in debugging and comparison
- **Reproducible Results**: Enables reproducible fingerprinting for testing

**Cryptographic Hash Generation:**

```rust
let combined = components.join("||");
let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
combined.hash(&mut hasher);
let hash = hasher.finish();
```

The hashing system creates a compact, unique fingerprint:

**Component Combination:**

- **Delimiter Separation**: Uses `||` delimiter to separate components clearly
- **Collision Avoidance**: Delimiter choice minimizes risk of component collision
- **String Concatenation**: Creates single string for consistent hashing
- **Reproducible Format**: Same components always produce same combined string
- **Debugging Support**: Combined string can be examined for debugging

**Hash Algorithm Selection:**

- **Default Hasher**: Uses Rust`s default hasher for good performance and distribution
- **64-bit Output**: Provides 64-bit hash for good uniqueness with reasonable size
- **Performance Optimization**: Default hasher is optimized for performance
- **Collision Resistance**: Provides good collision resistance for fingerprinting use
- **Deterministic Results**: Same input always produces same hash output

**Comprehensive Logging and Debugging:**

```rust
println!("Hardware fingerprint components: {:?}", components);
println!("Generated hash: {}", hash);
```

The debugging output provides essential troubleshooting information:

- **Component Visibility**: Shows exactly which components were used
- **Hash Transparency**: Displays the generated hash for verification
- **Debugging Support**: Enables troubleshooting of fingerprinting issues
- **Security Auditing**: Provides audit trail of fingerprinting operations
- **Development Support**: Aids in development and testing of fingerprinting logic

**Security Considerations and Design Principles:**
